## **Why Write Coding Exercises?**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "3d37c68d8a"
```

`@part1`
1. Provide a guided way to learn
2. Teach simple functions
3. Create a strong base to build from

## **Elements of a Coding Exercise**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e553aabdf1"
```

`@part1`
- Context
- Instructions
- Hint
- Pre-Exercise Code
- Sample Code
- Solution
- Submission Correctness Test (SCT)

## **Context**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "911365bcbc"
```

`@part1`
_"Provide background information relevant for solving exercise" - DataCamp_

- Set up Why

- Tools/Variables

- Bigger Picture

## **Example: Context**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "63d6e33157"
```

`@part1`
"The Galton data has already been read into a dataset called **heights**. These data include the heights of 928 adult children **child_ht**, together with an index of their parents' height **parent_ht**. The video explored the distribution of the parents' height; in this assignment, we investigate the distribution of the heights of the adult children."

## **Instructions**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0e9168e65a"
```

`@part1`
- "list specific tasks you want learners to perform"


`@script`
purple


---
## **Example: Instructions**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "8f9f2d2f48"
```

`@part1`
- Define the height of an adult child as a local variable
- Use the function `mean()` to calculate the mean and the function `sd()` to calculate the standard deviation
- Use the normal approximation and the function `pnorm()` to determine the probability that a child's height is less than 72 inches.

## **Hint**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d820acc07a"
```

`@part1`
- "Give a hint learners can take when they get stuck"


`@script`
also script


---
## **Example: Hint**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "de9610a79e"
```

`@part1`
Remember that we can reference a variable, say **var**, from a data set such as **heights**, as **heights$var**.


`@script`
is this a word

## **Pre-Exercise Code**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e56268b523"
```

`@part1`
- "Run code behind the scenes to load packages, define variables, etc."


`@script`
maybe this

## **Example: Pre-Exercise Code**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "10d6b8c9b6"
```

`@part1`
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
heights <- read.csv("https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/2610/datasets/c85ede6c205d22049e766bd08956b225c576255b/galton_height.csv", header = TRUE)
```


`@script`
pls work

## **Solution**

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "198563eb64"
```

`@part1`
- "Give the ideal solution to the exercise, which learners can request if needed"

## **Example: Solution**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5ed297d52c"
```

`@part1`
```{r}
ht_child <- heights$child_ht
mchild <- mean(ht_child)
sdchild <- sd(ht_child)
pr=pnorm(72,mean=mchild, sd=sdchild)
```


`@script`

## **Sample Code**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "30f829f1f6"
```

`@part1`
- "Start learners off with some code scaffolding in the editor"

## **Example: Sample Code**

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "bbc830c6d5"
```

`@part1`
```{r}
ht_child <- heights$child_ht
mchild <- mean(ht_child)
sdchild <- sd(ht_child)
pr=pnorm(72,mean=mchild, sd=sdchild)
```


`@part2`
```{r}
#Define the variable
ht_child <- ___

#Calculate the mean height
mchild <- ___
mchild

#Calculate the standard deviation of heights
sdchild <- ___
sdchild

#Determine the probability that a child's height is less than 72 inches
pr=___(___, mean=___, sd=___)
